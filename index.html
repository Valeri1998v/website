                    <h2>Saw</h2>
                    <p>Two strangers awaken in a room with no recollection
                    of how they got there, and soon discover they're pawns in a deadly game
                      perpetrated by a notorious serial killer. Waking up in a bathroom, two
                      men, Adam and Dr. Lawrence Gordon, discover they have been captured by
                        the infamous Jigsaw Killer. The men must escape before time runs out,
                        otherwise, they will face the deadly consequences.<p>
                        <h2>Evil dead</h2>
                        <p>Five Michigan State University students – Ash Williams, 
                          his girlfriend Linda, his sister Cheryl, their friend Scott, and Scott's 
                          girlfriend Shelly – vacation at an isolated cabin in rural Tennessee. 
                          Approaching the cabin, the group notices the porch swing move on its 
                          own but suddenly stop as Scott grabs the doorknob. While Cheryl draws a 
                          picture of a clock, the clock stops, and she hears a faint, demonic voice 
                          tell her to "join us". Her hand becomes possessed, turns pale and draws a 
                          picture of a book with a demonic face on its cover. Although shaken, she 
                          does not mention the incident...</p>
                          <h2>Us</h2>
                          <p>In 1986, a young girl named Adelaide “Addy” Thomas

                            Cruz Beach Boardwalk, she wanders away from her parents and enters a 
                            funhouse, where she encounters a doppelgänger of herself in the house 
                            of mirrors. Following the encounter she stops speaking and withdraws 
                            from her family...</p>
                          <h2>The shining</h2>
                          <p>A novelist - Jack Torrance takes a job interview as

                          <h2>The witch</h2>
                          <p>In 1630s New England, English settler William and his
                            family—wife Katherine, daughter Thomasin, son Caleb, and fraternal twins 
                            Mercy and Jonas—are banished from a Puritan colony over a religious dispute.
                            The family builds a farm near a large, secluded forest and Katherine bears 
                            her fifth child, Samuel. One day, when Thomasin is playing peekaboo with 
                            Samuel, the baby abruptly disappears. It is soon revealed that a witch has 
                            stolen the unbaptized Samuel, killing him and using his body to make a 
                            flying ointment for her broomstick and her body.</p>
                          <h2>Get out</h2>
                          <p>Rose Armitage is taking her boyfriend, Chris Washington,
                            to meet her parents for the first time. He's a bit uneasy about how they'll
                            treat him, as they're white and he's black. However, her parents turn out 
                            to be unfazed and everything seems to be going fine. Chris then starts to 
                            notice some weird behavioral traits with the African-American staff at the 
                            house. The Armitages throw a huge party and Chris ends up in some awkward 
                            conversations with the guests. Initially, he just puts it down to the racial
                              difference, but then the guests', and Armitages', motives start to appear 
                              more sinister. Chris decides it is time to get out.</p>
